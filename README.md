## Shortest Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive Scheduling

## AIM:
To implement Shortest Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive Scheduling

## ALGORITHM:

Shortest Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive Scheduling is a scheduling algorithm that aims to minimize the average waiting time of processes in a CPU scheduling environment. It selects the process with the shortest burst time to execute first. The algorithm operates in a non-preemptive manner, meaning that once a process starts executing, it continues until it completes its entire burst time. To implement SJF, you first determine the burst time for each process and then sort the processes in ascending order of their burst times. The process with the shortest burst time is scheduled to run next. This process continues until all processes have been executed. SJF non-preemptive scheduling is effective in minimizing waiting times for shorter tasks but can lead to longer waiting times for longer tasks if they arrive early in the queue.
## PROGRAM:
```
def sjf_non_preemptive(processes, burst_time):
    n = len(processes)

    # Sort processes based on their burst times
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if burst_time[j] > burst_time[j + 1]:
                processes[j], processes[j + 1] = processes[j + 1], processes[j]
                burst_time[j], burst_time[j + 1] = burst_time[j + 1], burst_time[j]

    # Calculate waiting time for each process
    waiting_time = [0] * n
    waiting_time[0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        waiting_time[i] = burst_time[i - 1] + waiting_time[i - 1]

    # Calculate turnaround time for each process
    turnaround_time = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        turnaround_time[i] = waiting_time[i] + burst_time[i]

    # Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time
    total_waiting_time = sum(waiting_time)
    total_turnaround_time = sum(turnaround_time)
    average_waiting_time = total_waiting_time / n
    average_turnaround_time = total_turnaround_time / n

    # Print the results
    print("Process\tBurst Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time")
    for i in range(n):
        print(f"{processes[i]}\t{burst_time[i]}\t\t{waiting_time[i]}\t\t{turnaround_time[i]}")

## RESULT: 
Priority Preemptive scheduling is implemented successfully.

## AIM: 
To implement Priority Non-Preemptive Scheduling

## ALGORITHM:
In Priority Non-Preemptive Scheduling, each process is associated with a priority value, which is used to determine the order in which processes are executed. The scheduler selects the process with the highest priority from the ready queue and allows it to execute until completion. If multiple processes have the same highest priority, they are executed in the order they arrived, following a FCFS approach. This algorithm continues until all processes have completed their execution.

## PROGRAM:
```
def priority_non_preemptive(processes, burst_time, priorities):
    n = len(processes)
    completion_time = [0] * n

    total_waiting_time = 0
    total_turnaround_time = 0

    # Create a list of tuples containing process information
    process_info = [(processes[i], burst_time[i], priorities[i]) for i in range(n)]

    # Sort the processes based on their priorities (lower values indicate higher priority)
    process_info.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

    # Calculate completion times, waiting times, and turnaround times
    completion_time[0] = process_info[0][1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        completion_time[i] = completion_time[i - 1] + process_info[i][1]
    
    for i in range(n):
        turnaround_time[i] = completion_time[i]
        waiting_time[i] = turnaround_time[i] - burst_time[i]
        total_waiting_time += waiting_time[i]
        total_turnaround_time += turnaround_time[i]

    # Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time
    average_waiting_time = total_waiting_time / n
    average_turnaround_time = total_turnaround_time / n
